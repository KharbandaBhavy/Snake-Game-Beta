# Snake Game (Beta Version)
**Not all the projects are for conclusions, some are made for fun as well.**

---
> Here is a snake game coded in C++
* a -> left moment
* d -> right moment
* w -> up moment
* s -> down moment
* x -> for Exit

Just simply run the code in Codeblocks of Microsoft Visual studio in a console app and enjoy the game.

Happy coding..........
